Brandon Cordova Summary:

The most challenging part of the project was determining which
tables belonged in each database. Understanding the importance
of primary keys and how one relation depends on another
was a key learning skill in this project.It was an intereseting experience
creating a database from scratch and applying our knowledge
of queries to create a functional database to use.
